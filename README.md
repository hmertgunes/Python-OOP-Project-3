# Python-OOP-Project-3-

I wrote this project while I was studying OOP with "Advanced Python: Python OOP with 10 Real-World Programs" course.

Title: Math Painting

Description: An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it.
